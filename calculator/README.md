# BMI Calculator

The Body Mass Index (BMI) or Quetelet index is a value derived from the mass (weight) and height of an individual, male or female. The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height and is universally expressed in units of kg/m2, resulting from the mass in kilograms and height in meters. The formula is: 
 

BMI = (mass or weight)/(height*height)
where,
mass or weight is in Kg,
height is in meters

I have made a program to calculate BMI.
