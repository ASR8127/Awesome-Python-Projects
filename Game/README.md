# Tic-Tac-Toe Game using Python

I have used Python to construct an automatic version of the well-known game Tic-Tac-Toe. There is no need for user input because the programme plays the game automatically.
numpy and random Python libraries are used to build this game. Code randomly selects a spot on the board and places the mark rather than asking the user to do it.
It will display the board after each turn unless a player wins.It returns -1 if the game is a draw.
